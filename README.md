# Song_Popularity_Model

From the beginning, our understanding of cultural shifts in popular music has been reliant on anecdote and history â€” until now. Working with digitalized music files has opened new ways of understanding what it is that makes a track record a hit or a miss.  
The revenues of the music industry have shifted a lot over the years, and streaming revenues are now the major part.  

There are key attributes in music popularity, which have evolved over the years. It would be ideal for artists to know which metrics affect their music composition, in order to gain more popularity, therefore increasing the overall revenue of their songs through online streaming platform such as Spotify.  
Therefore, a model was built for artists to know how to compose a music with higher chances to be hit the Top charts.  

The data was made available through Spotify Web API by a data-enthusiast on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks).
